## Hi there!

I'm Jadin Cross. As a computational linguist and conversational AI enthusiast, my career trajectory has been a testament to my dedication to merging technology with language. At NICE, my role as a Language Model Engineer allowed me to dive deep into multilingual natural language processing, honing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

With a foundation in Computer Science and Linguistics, my analytical approach has consistently contributed to advancements in conversational AI. My time at Molina Healthcare as a Business Analyst embodied my passion for applying conversational design and contact center analytics to real-world problems, ensuring tech-driven solutions align with human linguistic intricacies.

I love learning how language makes the whole world tick, and together with my computational skills, I believe I can do just that!
